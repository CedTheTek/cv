  <p>Freecodecamp is a website so you learn everything about coding</p> 
  <p>freeCodeCamp (also referred to as “Free Code Camp”) is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, <br> chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone. <br> </p>
  <p>freeCodeCamp is great in the sense that it's designed for complete beginners in the field of coding. <br> You can have no initial knowledge about coding, <br> and still register and start learning. <br> When I visited the site, I tried to see and examine the quality of freeCodeCamp's <br> HTML and HTML5 lessons. <br> </p>
  <p>freeCodeCamp is an awesome resource for self-learners. <br> It compiles the often scattered information about coding into clear and useful lessons. <br> If you are a self-learner, freeCodeCamp is a great place to start learning. <br> </p>
  <p>Free Code Camp's official position is that you should complete all 2,080 hours of the curriculum. <br> You will probably be a much stronger candidate (and command higher salaries in more challenging positions) if you do so. <br> Let's do some math: Front End Web Development certificate with Free Code Camp takes around 478 hours. <br> </p>
  <p>As told by Quincy Larson himself in this answer How does free code camp make money?, <br> they make money by job offerings and probably donations here and there by alumni. ... FreeCodeCamp is becoming wealthy in its <br> surplus of indebted software engineers making huge paychecks who know they owe it all to the guys over at FCC. <br> </p>
  <p>Realistically, just having any of the freeCodeCamp certifications is probably not enough to get a job. <br> By this I mean that anyone can go through the lessons, <br> build the projects, and apply for the certifications, <br> but how you do that will ultimately determine what those certifications are worth. <br> </p></td>
